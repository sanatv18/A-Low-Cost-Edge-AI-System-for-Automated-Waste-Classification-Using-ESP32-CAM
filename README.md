## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **low-cost Edge AI and IoT-based Smart Waste Classification System** developed using an **ESP32-CAM**, **Edge Impulse Machine Learning**, and **ThingSpeak Cloud**.

The ESP32-CAM captures images of waste objects and performs **real-time on-device object detection** using a trained Edge Impulse model. Once classified, a servo motor automatically directs the waste into the appropriate compartment while an OLED display shows the detected waste category along with its confidence score.

To enable remote monitoring, the ESP32 uploads classification results to the **ThingSpeak Cloud Platform**, allowing real-time visualization, historical data logging, and analytics.

This project demonstrates the integration of **Embedded Systems**, **Computer Vision**, **Machine Learning**, and **IoT Cloud Technologies** into a compact, low-cost, and energy-efficient smart waste management solution.

# ⚙ Working Principle

1. ESP32-CAM captures an image of the waste object.
2. The image is preprocessed and sent to the Edge Impulse model.
3. The model classifies the object as biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
4. Prediction label and confidence score are displayed on the OLED.
5. Servo motor rotates to the appropriate waste compartment.
6. Classification data is transmitted to ThingSpeak over Wi-Fi.
7. ThingSpeak stores and visualizes the data through cloud dashboards.
8. Servo returns to its default position and waits for the next object.

# 🚧 Challenges Faced

### Memory Constraints

Large image buffers exceeded available RAM on the ESP32.

**Solution**

Optimized image resolution and memory allocation.

---

### Lighting Variations

Detection accuracy decreased under poor illumination.

**Solution**
